            <li>Fry the Garlic – In a small saucepan or frying pan, add olive oil, minced garlic, and chopped rosemary. Cook over medium heat, constantly stirring, until the garlic starts to turn a light golden color, about 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Strain the Oil – Set a fine-mesh strainer over a medium bowl. Immediately strain the garlic oil mixture—Reserve the fried garlic and rosemary bits to add to the potatoes after roasting.</li>
            <li>Season the Potatoes – Add the quartered potatoes to the bowl with the garlic-infused oil. Add salt and pepper, tossing until evenly coated./li>
            <li>Roast – Spread evenly on a large baking sheet and roast for 20 minutes. Use a spatula to turn over the potatoes and roast for another 20 minutes. Turn and roast until potatoes are crisp and tender, about 10 to 20 minutes more.</li>
